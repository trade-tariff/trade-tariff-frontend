        🧹**Environment Cleanup Policy**
         - Nightly cleanup: All preview environments with the `needs-preview` label are removed automatically at midnight.
         - Immediate teardown: When a PR is closed or the `needs-preview`/`keep-preview` label is removed, the associated environment is destroyed immediately.
         - Retention override: Add the `keep-preview` label to retain a preview environment beyond the nightly cleanup.
