    <p>You can ask HMRC to give you a legally binding decision on your goods. You may want to consider this if your goods are:</p>

      <li>hard to classify and informal advice is not suitable for you or your business</li>
      <li>a new type of product (this will be the first time the product will have ever been classified)</li>
