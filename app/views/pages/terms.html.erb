<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>

  The Online Trade Tariff service (“Service”) is operated by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). We will refer to HMRC as ‘we’ from now on.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using the Online Trade Tariff</h2>

<p>
  You agree to use the service only for lawful purposes. You must use it in a way that does not infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of, this site by anyone else.
</p>

<p>
  We update the service regularly and may change or remove content at any time without notice.
</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scope of the service</h2>
