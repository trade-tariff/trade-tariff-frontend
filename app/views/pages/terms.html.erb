<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Summary</h2>

<p>
  Users of the <%= service_name %> should be aware that in any case where
  information on this website is at variance with that contained in the
  appropriate legislation, the latter will represent the correct legal position.
</p>

<p>
  Whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the Tariff on GOV.UK,
  the onus remains with the user to consult published legislation as necessary
  and to ensure that the correct duties are paid at importation.
</p>

<p>
  In instances where the Customs Authorities are at error, the importer or
  exporter may still be liable for any additional duty that may be demanded as
  a result of that error being discovered.
