        Check if you are eligible for the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland
      </h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      Traders may be able to use the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements when moving goods within the UK's internal market. This applies to goods moving from a business in Great Britain (England, Scotland, or Wales) to a business in Northern Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
     These simplified processes will be introduced when the new arrangements for parcels and freight under the Windsor Framework come into effect no earlier than 1 May 2025.

    <p>

    <p>
      UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) authorised traders that move goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland using the simplified processes can submit a simplified data set rather than a full declaration, as well as benefitting from zero customs duties.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Categorisation of goods</h3>

    <p>
      Categorisation is based on legal regulations and the specific composition and origin of goods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traders must check the category of their goods to determine if they are eligible to use the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements.
    </p>

    <p>Goods can be:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Category 1:</span>
        not eligible for simplified processes and subject to full customs duties and checks
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Category 2</span> or
        <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Standard goods:</span>
        eligible for simplified processes
      </li>
    </ul>
