        simplified process for internal market movements (SPIMM) (opens in new tab)
      </a>
      as part of the Windsor Framework.
    <p>

    <p>
      From 30 September 2024, UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) authorised traders that move goods from Great Britain
      to Northern Ireland through SPIMM can submit a simplified data set rather than a full declaration,
      as well as benefitting from zero customs duties and reduced checks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use this tool to help you check::
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>what is required for SPIMM</li>
      <li>the category of your goods</li>
      <li>what to do next</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Categorisation of goods</h3>

    <p>
      Categorisation is a complex process based on legal regulations, and the specific composition and origin of goods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traders must check the category of their goods to determine if they are eligible to move through SPIMM.
    </p>

    <p>Goods can be:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Category 1:</span>
        not eligible for SPIMM and subject to full customs duties and checks
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Category 2</span> or
        <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Standard Category:</span>
        eligible for SPIMM
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h3>

    <p>You'll need to know:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          the non-preferential origin of your goods
