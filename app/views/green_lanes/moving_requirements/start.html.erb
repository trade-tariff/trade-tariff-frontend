    <p>
      Use this tool if you are a trader moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and believe that your goods are 'not of risk' of onward movement to the EU.
    <p>

    <p>
      For eligible goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, traders can benefit from a simplified process for internal market movements.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're based anywhere in the UK, you can join the UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) to access the simplified process and benefit from reduced customs duties and checks.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use this tool to:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>check if your goods could be eligible for the simplified process for internal market movements</li>
      <li>check measures, criteria and exemptions for the movements of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
      <li>find information required for your necessary form submissions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Before you start</h3>
    <p>
      You'll need to know:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>that your goods are 'not at risk' of onward movement to the EU</li>
        <li>the commodity code of the goods</li>
        <li>the non-preferential origin of your goods</li>
        <li>when the movement of goods is taking place</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
