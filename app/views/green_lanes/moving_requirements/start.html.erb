    <p class="govuk-body">
      When moving eligible goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland from 30th September 2024, UK-based traders can <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-authorisation-for-the-uk-internal-market-scheme-if-you-bring-goods-into-northern-ireland' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>join the UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS) (opens in a new tab) </a> to benefit from reduced customs duties and checks.
    <p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
     Depending on the specific composition and origin of your goods, they will be given a category (Category 1, 2 or Standard). This will determine whether your movement of goods can continue through the simplified process for internal market movements.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Use this tool to check:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>if you are eligible for the simplified process</li>
      <li>the category of your goods</li>
      <li>what to do next to continue through the simplified process</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The simplified process is only available for the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>
