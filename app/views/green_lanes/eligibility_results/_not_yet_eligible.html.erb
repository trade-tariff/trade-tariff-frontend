    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Category 1: not eligible for simplified processes and subject to full customs processes</li>
      <li>Category 2: eligible for simplified processes but must meet certain requirements and conditions, including document controls</li>
      <li>Standard goods: eligible for simplified processes</li>
