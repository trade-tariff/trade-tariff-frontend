          Quotas allow a limited amount of goods to be imported at a lower duty
          rate. Once the quota has been used up, you will revert to the out-of-quota
          rate, which may be the third-country duty or a preferential rate.
        </p>

        <p class='govuk-body-s'>
          Quotas can be non-preferential (open to many countries) or preferential
          (restricted to a particular trading partner).

          Some trade agreements allow a duty drawback.

          This means that, if you pay duties on non-originating materials that
          you use to make a product which you then export under a preferential
          tariff, you can apply for a refund of those duties.
        example:
          title: Duty drawback - an example
          content_md: |
            * A car engine originating in country A is imported into country B
              and a 10% import duty is charged.
            * The car engine is assembled into a complete car in country B and
              then exported to country C, meeting the rules of origin requirements.
            * Using duty drawback, the car manufacturer in country B could
              'draw back' the 10% duties paid on the car engine originating in
              country A.

            summary: What kind of product-specific rules are there?
            content_md: |
              Broadly speaking, there are four types of rule that determine if
              your product has been sufficiently transformed to be considered as
              originating.

              - **The 'value added' rule**
                The value of all non-originating materials used cannot exceed a
                given percentage of the product’s ex-works price.
              - **Change of tariff classification**
                The production process results in a change of tariff
                classification between the non-originating materials and the
                final product.
              - **Manufacture from certain products**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns. Such rules are mostly used in the textile and
                clothing and chemical sectors.
              - **Specific processes**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns.
        operations_requirements:
          title: "Meeting minimal operations requirements: sufficient working or processing"
          body_md: |
            You will also be required to demonstrate that the work carried out
            on non-originating components goes beyond the **minimal operations**
            requirements defined in the %{scheme_title}.

            If the production performed in your country is one of those listed
            and nothing else was made there, meaning no material was produced or
            transformed, the product cannot be considered as originating, even
            if the product-specific rules of origin were satisfied.
        parts:
          title: Including parts or components from other countries
          body_md: |
            You may also be able to include non-originating materials imported
            from third countries or processing carried out in a non-partner
            country, as originating in the EU or a trade partner country,

      tolerances:
        caption: Are your goods originating?
        title: Tolerances
        intro_md: |
          'Tolerances' represent a provision for the relaxation of the rules of
          origin under certain conditions.

          They allow a small amount of non-originating materials to be used in
          the production of the good without affecting its originating status.
        examples:
          summary: Practical examples of tolerance clauses
          content_md: |
            1. A good is subject to a 60% value added calculations rule which
               requires originating materials to constitute at least 60% of the
               total value of the product. The tolerance rule under the
               agreement is set at 10%. The rule cannot be applied to mean that
               this threshold can be reduced by 10%.
            2. A good is subject to a change in tariff classification rule. It
               complies with the rule but 5% of the non-originating materials
               have not gone through a change in tariff classification. The
               tolerance rule under the agreement is set at 10%. Tolerance can
               be applied and the 5% is allowed for the purpose of determining
               origin.

      cumulation:
        caption: Are your goods originating?
        title: Including parts or components from other countries
        body_md: |
          In order to qualify for preferential treatment, you may be able to
          include parts that come from other countries. This depends on the
          **cumulation rules** of the trade agreement, which are described
          below.

          **Cumulation** may allow for the origin of materials or processing
          undertaken in country A to be added to the materials and processing
          undertaken within country B, so long as they are further processed
          or added to products originating in country B.

          This allows those factors that contributed to the origin of country
          A materials to be considered as though undertaken in B.

          Manufacturing and processing operations must be more than simple
          operations or processes, and must need special skills, machines,
          apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed to carry out
          the manufacture or process.

          Some operations are regarded as too minor to confer originating status
          to non-originating materials that are used in the production of your
          goods. These operations are referred to as 'insufficient processing'
          and are specific to each trade agreement.
        operations:

            Some of the listed operations can be clearly identified as
            insufficient operations, such as the affixing of a label on the
            product. However, there are also some operations that need to be
            assessed further as they contain the term ‘simple’, for example
            ‘simple assembly’.

            ‘Simple’ usually describes activities which do not need special
            skills, machines, apparatus, or equipment especially produced or
            installed for carrying out the activity. This term may be further
            defined so that the skills, machines, apparatus, or tools used must
            also contribute to the product’s essential characteristics or
            properties.

            _Also known as the 'roll-up' or intermediate materials provision._

            Once a part or intermediate material obtains originating status
            under an FTA, it is considered to be 100% originating when used for
            further processing even if inputs used for the production of this
            part or intermediate material were not originating.

            Once the originating status is obtained, the non-originating inputs
            are fully absorbed and not taken into account. In other words, the
            value of non-originating materials used in the production of the
            good will be disregarded once this good obtains originating status.
          inset: |
            **Example of the absorption principle**

            Part A is made of non-originating materials. The rule of origin for
            this part requires a change in tariff classification (CTC rule).

            The rule of origin is met and part A is considered originating.

            It is then used to manufacture the final product B which will be
            exported to an FTA partner.

            The rule of origin for the final product B requires non-originating
            materials not to exceed 40% of the value of the product (VA rule).
            For the calculation of regional value content part A is treated as
            100% originating based on the roll-up principle as all the
            non-originating materials used to produce it were absorbed once
            part A obtained originating status.
        sets:

            considered originating. In particular, it refers to situations
            where not all of the items in the set are originating.

            Sets, even when comprising of different items, can be classified
            under one commodity code based on the General Rules of
            Interpretation (GIR). Provisions on sets often set an originating
            value threshold above which the set is considered originating.
          part2: |
            A set, classified pursuant to paragraphs 3(b) and (c) of Part Two,
            Section 1, of the Tariff of the United Kingdom, will be considered
            as originating in a Party when all of its components are
            originating under this Origin Reference Document.

            Where the set is composed of originating and non-originating
            components, it will as a whole be considered as originating in a
            Party, provided that the value of the non-originating components
            does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works or free on board price
            of the set.

            summary: Example of a set
            content: |
              A stationery set consists of five different items. Based on the
              individual rules of origin for each products under the given FTA,
              four of these products are originating and one is not. The FTA
              states that sets can still be considered originating when the
              value of non-originating products does not exceed 10% of the
              value of the total set. As the non-originating product in this
              example constitutes 25% of the value, the set cannot be
              considered originating.

        description_html: |
          <p>
            Bilateral cumulation operates between 2 countries or trading blocs where a
            trade agreement contains a provision allowing them to cumulate origin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Materials originating in either country or bloc in the trade agreement will
            be considered as materials covered by the rule of origin.
          </p>
        example_list_md: |
          1. A company in country A would like to take advantage of the FTA with country B to receive 0% import duties on the import of goods which require 100% of the value to be originating.
          2. The goods are comprised of component parts that are sourced from both country A and country B.
          3. As there is bilateral cumulation between the two countries and all component parts are sourced in either country A or country B, the goods can be considered as originating.
          4. Even if all the parts came from country A and were just assembled in country B, the rules would be met.

             Goods may only be considered as originating if the parts from Country B
             have been processed to a degree beyond what is defined in
             the [insufficient processing clause](%{sufficient_processing_link}).
      extended:
        description_html: |
            <p>
              Extended cumulation (also referred to as third-party or cross cumulation) allows for
               cumulation between countries which are not linked by a trade agreement or are linked
               by a trade agreement with different rules of origin to influence the origin of goods
               in the trade agreement between the two primary countries or blocs.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are allowed to use inputs from a third-party country, which is not a member of the
               applicable FTA and consider them originating, provided that they meet the rules of
               origin under the relevant trade agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Extended cumulation is the most flexible type of cumulation of originating inputs and is
              often limited to certain tariff headings, subheadings and codes or to certain types of
              products only. Please check the detailed agreement text.
            </p>
        example_list_md: |
          1. In order to take advantage of a 0% import duty, a business in Country A would like to import a product
          from Country B where product-specific rules dictate that at least 50% of the materials that go to make up
          the product are originating.
          2. Only 35% of the components of the items were manufactured in Country B.
          3. The trade deal between Country A and Country B permits components originating in Country C to count as originating
          in Country B under certain circumstances, via **Extended Cumulation**, even though there is no Trade Agreement between
          Country A and Country C.
          4. Country B sources components from Country C that make up 20% of the total value of the product.
          5. As 35% + 20% exceeds the 50% threshold, extended cumulation permits the trade to go ahead and for the preferential
          tariff for trade in goods between Country A and Country B to be legitimately claimed.

             Goods may only be considered as originating if the parts from Country B have been processed to a degree beyond what
             is defined in the [insufficient processing clause](%{sufficient_processing_link}).
      regional:
        description_html: |
          <p>
            Regional cumulation is a form of diagonal cumulation, which only exists under the Generalised
            Scheme of Preferences.
          </p>
      full:
        description_html: |
          <p>
            Full cumulation allows for the working or processing carried out on the materials that
            is more than insufficient in the countries participating in agreement to be considered as
            carried out in the final country of production.
          </p>
      diagonal:
        description_html: |
            <p>
              Diagonal cumulation operates between more than 2 countries.
            </p>

            <p>
              Materials originating in a defined country or countries, may be used as materials originating in the country of export, when used in an export to a country not in the agreement. Diagonal cumulation comes with two crucial conditions attached:
            </p>
        description_list_md: |
          1. all countries involved need to be joined by FTAs *and*
          2. rules of origin in these FTAs need to be identical.
        example_text: |
          1. Importers in country A would like to import goods from country B
          2. Country A has a trade agreement with Country B
          3. An insufficient percentage of the goods to be imported were manufactured in Country B
          4. Country A also has a trade agreement with Country C, as does Country B and a percentage of the goods were manufactured in Country C
          5. The origin requirements between the two countries for the commodity are the same
          6. As a result, the parts of the commodity manufactured in Country C can be counted as originating in Country B.
