          Some trade agreements allow a duty drawback.

          This means that, if you pay duties on non-originating materials that
          you use to make a product which you then export under a preferential
          tariff, you can apply for a refund of those duties.
        example:
          title: Duty drawback - an example
          content_md: |
            * A car engine originating in country A is imported into country B
              and a 10% import duty is charged.
            * The car engine is assembled into a complete car in country B and
              then exported to country C, meeting the rules of origin requirements.
            * Using duty drawback, the car manufacturer in country B could
              'draw back' the 10% duties paid on the car engine originating in
              country A.

            summary: What kind of product-specific rules are there?
            content_md: |
              Broadly speaking, there are four types of rule that determine if
              your product has been sufficiently transformed to be considered as
              originating.

              - **The 'value added' rule**
                The value of all non-originating materials used cannot exceed a
                given percentage of the product’s ex-works price.
              - **Change of tariff classification**
                The production process results in a change of tariff
                classification between the non-originating materials and the
                final product.
              - **Manufacture from certain products**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns. Such rules are mostly used in the textile and
                clothing and chemical sectors.
              - **Specific processes**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns.
        operations_requirements:
          title: "Meeting minimal operations requirements: sufficient working or processing"
          body_md: |
            You will also be required to demonstrate that the work carried out
            on non-originating components goes beyond the **minimal operations**
            requirements defined in the %{scheme_title}.

            If the production performed in your country is one of those listed
            and nothing else was made there, meaning no material was produced or
            transformed, the product cannot be considered as originating, even

        intro_md: |
          'Tolerances' represent a provision for the relaxation of the rules of
          origin under certain conditions.

          They allow a small amount of non-originating materials to be used in
          the production of the good without affecting its originating status.
        examples:
          summary: Practical examples of tolerance clauses
          content_md: |
            1. A good is subject to a 60% value added calculations rule which
               requires originating materials to constitute at least 60% of the
               total value of the product. The tolerance rule under the
               agreement is set at 10%. The rule cannot be applied to mean that
               this threshold can be reduced by 10%.
            2. A good is subject to a change in tariff classification rule. It
               complies with the rule but 5% of the non-originating materials
               have not gone through a change in tariff classification. The
               tolerance rule under the agreement is set at 10%. Tolerance can
               be applied and the 5% is allowed for the purpose of determining
               origin.

      cumulation:
        caption: Are your goods originating?
        title: Including parts or components from other countries
        body_md: |
          In order to qualify for preferential treatment, you may be able to
          include parts that come from other countries. This depends on the
          **cumulation rules** of the trade agreement, which are described
          below.

          **Cumulation** may allow for the origin of materials or processing
          undertaken in country A to be added to the materials and processing
          undertaken within country B, so long as they are further processed
          or added to products originating in country B.

          This allows those factors that contributed to the origin of country
          A materials to be considered as though undertaken in B.

          In order to qualify for preferential treatment, non-originating parts
          must be sufficiently processed to count as originating.

          Manufacturing and processing operations must be more than simple
          operations or processes, and must need special skills, machines,
          apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed to carry out
          the manufacture or process.

          Some operations are regarded as too minor to confer originating status
          to non-originating materials that are used in the production of your
          goods. These operations are referred to as 'insufficient processing'
          and are specific to each trade agreement.
        operations:
          summary: What are simple operations?
          content: |
            Some of the listed operations can be clearly identified as
            insufficient operations, such as the affixing of a label on the
            product. However, there are also some operations that need to be
            assessed further as they contain the term ‘simple’, for example
            ‘simple assembly’.

            ‘Simple’ usually describes activities which do not need special
            skills, machines, apparatus, or equipment especially produced or
            installed for carrying out the activity. This term may be further
            defined so that the skills, machines, apparatus, or tools used must
            also contribute to the product’s essential characteristics or
            properties.

        absorption:
          title: The absorption principle
          content: |
            _Also known as the 'roll-up' or intermediate materials provision._

            Once a part or intermediate material obtains originating status
            under an FTA, it is considered to be 100% originating when used for
            further processing even if inputs used for the production of this
            part or intermediate material were not originating.

            Once the originating status is obtained, the non-originating inputs
            are fully absorbed and not taken into account. In other words, the
            value of non-originating materials used in the production of the
            good will be disregarded once this good obtains originating status.
          inset: |
            **Example of the absorption principle**

            Part A is made of non-originating materials. The rule of origin for
            this part requires a change in tariff classification (CTC rule).

            The rule of origin is met and part A is considered originating.

            It is then used to manufacture the final product B which will be
            exported to an FTA partner.

            The rule of origin for the final product B requires non-originating
            materials not to exceed 40% of the value of the product (VA rule).
            For the calculation of regional value content part A is treated as
            100% originating based on the roll-up principle as all the
            non-originating materials used to produce it were absorbed once
            part A obtained originating status.
        sets:
          title: Sets
          part1: |
            _If your product is a set, you may be able to apply an additional
            tolerance._

            A provision that clarifies circumstances under which sets can be
            considered originating. In particular, it refers to situations
            where not all of the items in the set are originating.

            Sets, even when comprising of different items, can be classified
            under one commodity code based on the General Rules of
            Interpretation (GIR). Provisions on sets often set an originating
            value threshold above which the set is considered originating.
          part2: |
            A set, classified pursuant to paragraphs 3(b) and (c) of Part Two,
            Section 1, of the Tariff of the United Kingdom, will be considered
            as originating in a Party when all of its components are
            originating under this Origin Reference Document.

            Where the set is composed of originating and non-originating
            components, it will as a whole be considered as originating in a
            Party, provided that the value of the non-originating components
            does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works or free on board price
            of the set.
          details:
            summary: Example of a set
            content: |
              A stationery set consists of five different items. Based on the
              individual rules of origin for each products under the given FTA,
              four of these products are originating and one is not. The FTA
              states that sets can still be considered originating when the
              value of non-originating products does not exceed 10% of the
              value of the total set. As the non-originating product in this
              example constitutes 25% of the value, the set cannot be
              considered originating.

          2. The goods are comprised of component parts that are sourced from both country A and country B.
          3. As there is bilateral cumulation between the two countries and all component parts are sourced in either country A or country B, the goods can be considered as originating.
          4. Even if all the parts came from country A and were just assembled in country B, the rules would be met.

             Goods may only be considered as originating if the parts from Country B
             have been processed to a degree beyond what is defined in

          <p>
            Extended cumulation (also referred to as third-party or cross cumulation) allows for
             cumulation between countries which are not linked by a trade agreement or are linked
             by a trade agreement with different rules of origin to influence the origin of goods
             in the trade agreement between the two primary countries or blocs.

          <p>
            You are allowed to use inputs from a third-party country, which is not a member of the

             origin under the relevant trade agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Extended cumulation is the most flexible type of cumulation of originating inputs and is

          from Country B where product-specific rules dictate that at least 50% of the materials that go to make up
          the product are originating.
          2. Only 35% of the components of the items were manufactured in Country B.
          3. The trade deal between Country A and Country B permits components originating in Country C to count as originating
          in Country B under certain circumstances, via **Extended Cumulation**, even though there is no Trade Agreement between
          Country A and Country C.
          4. Country B sources components from Country C that make up 20% of the total value of the product.
          5. As 35% + 20% exceeds the 50% threshold, extended cumulation permits the trade to go ahead and for the preferential
          tariff for trade in goods between Country A and Country B to be legitimately claimed.

             Goods may only be considered as originating if the parts from Country B have been processed to a degree beyond what

            question: What is Categorisation and why is it important?
            answer: |
              <p>
              When the full Windsor Framework is implemented, we will introduce simplified processes for Internal Market Movements. Goods will need to be categorised to determine if they are eligible to move under the simplified processes, where:
                <ul>
                  <li>Category 1 goods are not eligible for using the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements</li>
                  <li>Category 2 and Standard goods are eligible for using the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements</li>
                </ul>
              Categorisation of goods is based on legal regulations, and the specific composition and origin of the goods. These regulations and the goods they cover may alter over time so the categorisation of your goods can also be subject to change.  The categorisation of the goods also has a bearing on how the internal market movement information (IMMI) should be completed.

                  <li>Category 1 goods are not eligible for the simplified processes and must follow full customs processes. These goods include those where there are prohibitions and restrictions – for example, total bans in the case of trade sanctions - and where there are quotas restricting volume of imports. Goods covered by EU trade defence measures also fall into Category 1.</li>
                  <li>Category 2 goods include excise products or goods subject to EU enforced special health, licensing or environmental controls. They are usually subject to licensing and documentary controls and may need to meet certain requirements and conditions to be moved. Category 2 goods are eligible for the simplified processes and can use a 8 digit commodity code when using IMMI.</li>
                  <li>Standard goods have no restrictions and traders can use a 6 digit commodity code when making movements using the IMMI.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
              Some category 2 goods can be treated as standard goods with the appropriate authorisation; for example if traders are moving food products and have UKIMS and NIRMS together then the additional requirements are waived.

          question_4:
            question: How do I categorise my goods and what support is available to me?
            answer: |
              <p>
              There are three routes where traders can find support to categorise their goods.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Using the Northern Ireland Online Tariff Tool</strong>
              <br />
              You are able to use the <a href="%{green_lanes_start_path}" target="_blank">eligibility tool</a> within the online tariff tool to help identify which categories apply to your goods.  The tool can also be accessed via an API which will be made available separately.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Using the Trader Goods Profile</strong>
              <br />
              A Trader Goods Profile is automatically created when you register for the UK Internal Market Scheme (UKIMS). Your profile can be used to maintain a list of your business’s commonly transported goods and their categorisation, which can be used by you or your intermediaries to submit your Internal Market Movement Information.
              <br />
              More information on the Trader Goods Profile and Internal Market Movement Information will be published soon.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Using the Trader Support Service</strong>
              <br />
              If you use the Trader Support Service to make movements into Northern Ireland, you will be able to also get support to find your goods category in the TSS portal. The TSS will provide information about your goods category and support you to complete your declarations and provide the relevant procedure code.
              </p>
          question_5:
            question: What is the difference between Categorisation and Classification?
            answer: |
              <p>
              Classification’ describes what the good is, whereas the ‘categorisation’ informs the obligations that need to be fulfilled in relation to that good.
              </p>
              <p>
              Therefore, you have to determine the classification of the good before you can determine which category it sits in.
              </p>
              <p>
              For example, if a trader is moving pencils, the trader must establish the relevant classification of the good: this is classification. Once this is done so they can proceed to establish the Windsor Framework category the commodity belongs to, taking into account any licenses or exemptions which may apply to that commodity under the Windsor Framework. This can be done via the Northern Ireland Online Tariff Tool, via the TGP or with the support of the Trader Support Service.
              </p>
          question_6:
            question: What is the <a href="%{green_lanes_start_path}" target="_blank">‘Eligibility Tool’ for the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</a>, and how can it help me?
            answer: |
              <p>
              This tool helps you to check:
                <ul>
                  <li>what is required to use the simplified processes for Internal Market Movements</li>
                  <li>the category of your goods</li>
                  <li>what to do next after obtaining a categorisation recommendation</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
              The tool cannot save or download category results.
              </p>
          question_7:
            question: Can I save or download a PDF copy of my commodity category results?
            answer: |
              <p>
              If you need to save or download your category results direct from the tool, you can take a screen capture or print the category results page.
              </p>
      category_2:
        heading: "Commodity codes"
        questions:
          question_1:
            question: I cannot seem to use my 6 digit HS code on the user interface of the categorisation tool?
            answer: |
              <p>
              The tool is designed to work best when reading a 10 digit commodity code. There are two known issues which you might encounter:
              <ul>
                <li>You will need to enter 10 digits on the UI. The tool is designed to look for a 10 digit number. Where you only have the 6 digit code, you can add extra zeros to pass this validation.</li>
                <li>Some issues with a 6 digit codes. In some instances, the tool will not recognise the 6 digit HS code because of overlap between header codes and actually commodity codes. You should be able to overcome this by providing the 8 or 10 digit code.</li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Traders should note that even if you have to input your 10 digit commodity code on the tool in order to categorise, you can still use a 6 digit or 8 digit commodity code when making IMMI declarations if your goods are eligible for SPIMM.</strong>
              </p>
          question_2:
            question: Can I move my Category 2 goods via EIDR?
            answer: |
              <p>
              It will be possible to use the Entry in Declarant’s Records (EIDR) process to move goods into Northern Ireland under the simplified processes. As well as the existing SCDP-EIDR authorisation, HMRC is introducing the UKIMS-EIDR authorisation to enable businesses to use the entry in declarant’s record process for certain goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
              </p>
              <p>
              Category 2 goods can move under EIDR where they are not subject to documentary controls that need to be presented upon entry to NI. <strong>In most cases, Additional Procedure Code 1EN should be declared in DE1/11.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              Where Additional Procedure Codes 1EL or 1LG are declared in DE1/11, use of EIDR is not permitted.
              </p>
              <p>
              The goods must meet certain other requirements to move using EIDR under the simplified processes, i.e.:
                <ul>
                  <li>meet the criteria to be moved as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-bring-your-goods-into-northern-ireland-from-great-britain-without-paying-duty" target="_blank">‘not at risk’</a> using UKIMS authorisation</li>
                  <li>have UK domestic status</li>
                  <li>not have any import controls</li>
                  <li>not have any licensing requirements.</li>
                  <li>not be subject to prohibitions or restrictions</li>
                  <li>not be in excise duty suspense</li>
                  <li>not be entering a customs duty suspense procedure</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
      category_3:
        heading: "Exemptions"
        questions:
          question_1:
            question: Must I meet all exemption requirements or just one?
            answer: |
              <p>
              The eligibility provides the conditions under which your goods might be exempt from a measure.
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
              <p>
              You might be presented with a list of category exemptions which might apply to your goods. In most cases, the trader should select at least one exemption that applies. These are likely to correspond to codes businesses already supply when making goods declarations.
              </p>
              <p>
              You only need to select one exemption even if all apply.
              </p>
              <p>
              For example, if moving multi-component integrated circuits originating from Brazil with the commodity code 8542 3211 00 from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland, you might be presented with two exemptions. In this case, traders only need to select one exemption.
              </p>
          question_2:
            question: Why have I been presented with both Category 1 and Category 2 exemption requirements?
            answer: |
              <p>
              The tool will identify any possible exemptions which apply against both Category 1 and Category 2, and you will be asked whether the exemptions apply.
              </p>
              <p>
              Category 1 takes precedence and, if no exemptions are met against Category 1, a user will not be asked about possible Category 2 exemptions. If Category 1 exemptions are met, you will be asked about Category 2 exemptions.
              </p>
          question_3:
            question: Where can I find legislation relating to a particular exemption requirement?
            answer: |
              <p>
              When using the tool you will be presented with questions relating to your goods. Once you have answered these questions you will be presented with the relevant legislation associated with any exemptions which may apply. Here you will be asked to confirm which exemption applies according to the legislation.
              </p>
          question_4:
            question: I was presented with a different exemption to the one I was expecting.
            answer: |
              <p>
              Goods exemptions might change alongside the tariff, you can use the eligibility tool or refer to your TGP for support. Where you are presented with an exemption that alters your goods category this is likely to be the most up to date exemption applicable to your good.
              </p>
          question_5:
            question: Why does the categorisation tool only use exemption codes to categorise my goods?
            answer: |
              <p>
              The eligibility tool only shows exemption codes as it needs to determine which rules under Annex IV of the Windsor Framework your goods are exempt from.
              </p>
              <p>
              For example, Common Health Entry Document (CHED) certificates do not appear in the list of exemptions as they are not considered exemptions. If you are using a CHED, it means you are not utilising an available exemption, and therefore you should select 'none of the above' from the listed options in the tool.
              </p>
      category_4:
        heading: "Procedure codes"
        questions:
          question_1:
            question: I know the category of my goods but OTT hasn’t told me which APCs to use.
            answer: |
              <p>
              The categorisation guidance on GOV.UK will list the relevant procedure codes for moving goods into NI, the TSS will also support traders select the relevant procedure codes needed for movements into NI.
              </p>
              <p>
              In March, the declaration completion instructions will be published on GOV.UK with more details on which procedure code and additional procedure code applies when.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>There are 4 new SPIMM APCs that will apply depending on the goods being moved</strong>
              </p>
              <p><strong>
              Depending on the type of goods being moved, the trader selects an appropriate APC
                <ul>
                  <li>1SG –Standard Goods (Non-Excise)</li>
                  <li>1LG – Licensable goods (Non-Excise)</li>
                  <li>1EN –Excise Non-Licensable</li>
                  <li>1EL – Excise Licensable</li>
                </ul>
              </strong></p>
      category_5:
        heading: "Excise"
        questions:
          question_1:
            question: How do I work out if my goods are excise goods and therefore category 2?
            answer: |
              <p>
              In most cases it will be clear if the goods are category 2 excise goods because they are subject to UK excise duty (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, fuels). Some goods may or may not be excisable depending, for example, on how they are to be used.
              </p>
              <p>
              The tool will return that these are potentially excise goods and a categorisation decision will need to be taken based on the circumstances applicable to the particular goods.
              </p>
              <p>
              Excise duty will never be payable through customs forms or processes on a GB to NI movement. In the rare circumstances that excise duty is payable on GB to NI movements separate excise accounting arrangements exist.
