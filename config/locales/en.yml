        <p>
          Quotas allow a limited amount of goods to be imported at a lower duty
          rate. Once the quota has been used up, you will revert to the out-of-quota
          rate, which may be the third-country duty or a preferential rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quotas can be non-preferential (open to many countries) or preferential
          (restricted to a particular trading partner).

        <p>
          Due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we recognise that some Ukrainian exporters,
          who do not hold Approved Exporter status and rely on EUR1 certificates to evidence the preferential origin of their goods,
          may not be able to obtain the duly endorsed certificates. In these cases,
          HMRC has introduced an easement enabling preference to be claimed by UK importers
          based on an unendorsed EUR1 certificate supported/or by alternative evidence that corroborates the originating status of the goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          To claim preference under this easement UK importers must enter code '9UKR' in Box 44 of the customs declaration.

          Some trade agreements allow a duty drawback.

          This means that, if you pay duties on non-originating materials that
          you use to make a product which you then export under a preferential
          tariff, you can apply for a refund of those duties.
        example:
          title: Duty drawback - an example
          content_md: |
            * A car engine originating in country A is imported into country B
              and a 10% import duty is charged.
            * The car engine is assembled into a complete car in country B and
              then exported to country C, meeting the rules of origin requirements.
            * Using duty drawback, the car manufacturer in country B could
              'draw back' the 10% duties paid on the car engine originating in
              country A.

          title: What are product-specific rules?
          body_md: |
            **Product-specific rules** define how a product needs to be
            processed to be considered as originating in %{trade_country_name}
            and therefore eligible for preferential tariff treatment.

            If there are multiple rules, your product needs only comply with one
            of them.
          details:
            summary: What kind of product-specific rules are there?
            content_md: |
              Broadly speaking, there are four types of rule that determine if
              your product has been sufficiently transformed to be considered as
              originating.

              - **The 'value added' rule**
                The value of all non-originating materials used cannot exceed a
                given percentage of the product’s ex-works price.
              - **Change of tariff classification**
                The production process results in a change of tariff
                classification between the non-originating materials and the
                final product.
              - **Manufacture from certain products**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns. Such rules are mostly used in the textile and
                clothing and chemical sectors.
              - **Specific processes**
                A specific production process is required. For example, spinning
                fibres into yarns.
        operations_requirements:
          title: "Meeting minimal operations requirements: sufficient working or processing"
          body_md: |
            You will also be required to demonstrate that the work carried out
            on non-originating components goes beyond the **minimal operations**
            requirements defined in the %{scheme_title}.

            If the production performed in your country is one of those listed
            and nothing else was made there, meaning no material was produced or
            transformed, the product cannot be considered as originating, even
            if the product-specific rules of origin were satisfied.
        parts:
          title: Including parts or components from other countries
          body_md: |
            You may also be able to include non-originating materials imported
            from third countries or processing carried out in a non-partner

      tolerances:
        caption: Are your goods originating?
        title: Tolerances
        intro_md: |
          'Tolerances' represent a provision for the relaxation of the rules of
          origin under certain conditions.

          They allow a small amount of non-originating materials to be used in
          the production of the good without affecting its originating status.
        examples:
          summary: Practical examples of tolerance clauses
          content_md: |
            1. A good is subject to a 60% value added calculations rule which
               requires originating materials to constitute at least 60% of the
               total value of the product. The tolerance rule under the
               agreement is set at 10%. The rule cannot be applied to mean that
               this threshold can be reduced by 10%.
            2. A good is subject to a change in tariff classification rule. It
               complies with the rule but 5% of the non-originating materials
               have not gone through a change in tariff classification. The
               tolerance rule under the agreement is set at 10%. Tolerance can
               be applied and the 5% is allowed for the purpose of determining
               origin.

      cumulation:
        caption: Are your goods originating?
        title: Including parts or components from other countries
        body_md: |
          In order to qualify for preferential treatment, you may be able to
          include parts that come from other countries. This depends on the
          **cumulation rules** of the trade agreement, which are described
          below.

          **Cumulation** may allow for the origin of materials or processing
          undertaken in country A to be added to the materials and processing
          undertaken within country B, so long as they are further processed
          or added to products originating in country B.

          This allows those factors that contributed to the origin of country
          A materials to be considered as though undertaken in B.

          Manufacturing and processing operations must be more than simple
          operations or processes, and must need special skills, machines,
          apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed to carry out
          the manufacture or process.

          Some operations are regarded as too minor to confer originating status
          to non-originating materials that are used in the production of your
          goods. These operations are referred to as 'insufficient processing'
          and are specific to each trade agreement.
        operations:
          summary: What are simple operations?
          content: |
            Some of the listed operations can be clearly identified as
            insufficient operations, such as the affixing of a label on the
            product. However, there are also some operations that need to be
            assessed further as they contain the term ‘simple’, for example
            ‘simple assembly’.

            ‘Simple’ usually describes activities which do not need special
            skills, machines, apparatus, or equipment especially produced or
            installed for carrying out the activity. This term may be further
            defined so that the skills, machines, apparatus, or tools used must
            also contribute to the product’s essential characteristics or
            properties.

        absorption:
          title: The absorption principle
          content: |
            _Also known as the 'roll-up' or intermediate materials provision._

            Once a part or intermediate material obtains originating status
            under an FTA, it is considered to be 100% originating when used for
            further processing even if inputs used for the production of this
            part or intermediate material were not originating.

            Once the originating status is obtained, the non-originating inputs
            are fully absorbed and not taken into account. In other words, the
            value of non-originating materials used in the production of the
            good will be disregarded once this good obtains originating status.
          inset: |
            **Example of the absorption principle**

            Part A is made of non-originating materials. The rule of origin for
            this part requires a change in tariff classification (CTC rule).

            The rule of origin is met and part A is considered originating.

            It is then used to manufacture the final product B which will be
            exported to an FTA partner.

            The rule of origin for the final product B requires non-originating
            materials not to exceed 40% of the value of the product (VA rule).
            For the calculation of regional value content part A is treated as
            100% originating based on the roll-up principle as all the
            non-originating materials used to produce it were absorbed once
            part A obtained originating status.
        sets:
          title: Sets
          part1: |
            _If your product is a set, you may be able to apply an additional
            tolerance._

            A provision that clarifies circumstances under which sets can be
            considered originating. In particular, it refers to situations
            where not all of the items in the set are originating.

            Sets, even when comprising of different items, can be classified
            under one commodity code based on the General Rules of
            Interpretation (GIR). Provisions on sets often set an originating
            value threshold above which the set is considered originating.
          part2: |
            A set, classified pursuant to paragraphs 3(b) and (c) of Part Two,
            Section 1, of the Tariff of the United Kingdom, will be considered
            as originating in a Party when all of its components are
            originating under this Origin Reference Document.

            Where the set is composed of originating and non-originating
            components, it will as a whole be considered as originating in a
            Party, provided that the value of the non-originating components
            does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works or free on board price
            of the set.

              A stationery set consists of five different items. Based on the
              individual rules of origin for each products under the given FTA,
              four of these products are originating and one is not. The FTA
              states that sets can still be considered originating when the
              value of non-originating products does not exceed 10% of the
              value of the total set. As the non-originating product in this
              example constitutes 25% of the value, the set cannot be
              considered originating.

          is permitted in the item.
          2. Only 35% of the components of the items were manufactured in Country B.
          3. The trade deal between Country A and Country B permits components originating in Country C to count as originating
          in Country B under certain circumstances, via **Extended Cumulation**, even though there is no Trade Agreement between

          4. Country B sources components from Country C that make up 20% of the total value of the product.
          5. As 35% + 20% exceeds the 50% threshold, extended cumulation permits the trade to go ahead and for the preferential

            Full cumulation allows for the working or processing carried out on the materials that 
            is more than insufficient in the countries participating in agreement to be considered as 
            carried out in the final country of production.

              Diagonal cumulation operates between more than 2 countries.

              Materials originating in a defined country or countries, may be used as materials originating in the country of export, when used in an export to a country not in the agreement. Diagonal cumulation comes with two crucial conditions attached:

          1. all countries involved need to be joined by FTAs *and* 
          2. rules of origin in these FTAs need to be identical.

          This is where it gets a little more complicated. Let’s say that as well as an FTA 
          with the UK, the EU has another one with Japan (currently being negotiated), and 
          the UK also has one with Japan (… maybe one day). If the rules of origin requirements in 
          the EU-UK FTA allow for diagonal cumulation explicitly with Japan, a UK producer could 
          import a good from Japan (that originates from Japan), incorporate it into something 
          else, alter it, do nothing with it, whatever, and then sell it to a customer in the EU 
          and it would be treated as if it was of UK origin no matter how much value was added, 
          or not, in the UK.
